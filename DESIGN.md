# DESIGN.md — second-brain-agent

Architecture decisions and the research behind them. If you just want to use
the system, read README.md instead.

## What this is

A self-improving agent loop that uses an Obsidian vault as persistent memory.
"Self-improving" here means the precise, real thing — not the hype version:

- **Self-learning** (the model updates its own weights) does not exist in
  production. No system you can run today does this.
- **Self-improving** (the *system around* the model compounds) is buildable
  now: each session writes lessons to memory, skills sharpen as rules get
  added, the memory index accumulates verified facts. The model stays the
  same; the environment it runs in gets sharper. (Karpathy calls the missing
  weight-update mechanism "continual learning" and estimates it's years away;
  his proposed interim is exactly this — "system prompt learning," where the
  agent edits its own instructions.)

## The agent loop, step by step

One **interactive Claude Code session = one iteration** (the "Ralph loop"
pattern — Geoffrey Huntley / Ryan Carson / Addy Osmani — adapted to
interactive use). `agent/loop.sh` just launches a session pre-seeded with
the protocol; `CLAUDE.md` enforces the same protocol if you run `claude`
bare:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Fresh interactive session starts         │
│ 2. session-start skill: load memory         │
│    (MEMORY.md + latest daily + reflection)  │
│ 3. Work on the goal (user can steer —       │
│    it's a normal Claude Code session)       │
│ 4. capture skill: save durable facts        │
│    to Knowledge/, index them in MEMORY.md   │
│ 5. reflect skill: log session to Daily/,    │
│    write lesson + proposal to Reflections/, │
│    git commit (audit trail)                 │
│ 6. User exits. Context is DISCARDED —       │
│    next session starts fresh at step 1      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         separately, run deliberately:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ agent/reflect.sh → improve skill (also      │
│ interactive): read Reflections/, apply      │
│ REPEATED signals as edits to skills /       │
│ MEMORY.md / config / CLAUDE.md, walk the    │
│ user through each diff, commit              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why fresh context every iteration?** Context degrades before it fills — one
benchmark shows recall dropping from ~98% to ~64% well within the window
("context rot"), with no error signal. The stateless-but-iterative design
sidesteps this: every iteration gets a clean window, and continuity lives in
files. This is the single most important reliability decision in the design.

**Why interactive instead of headless (`claude -p`)?** Karpathy's product
guidance: "Iron Man suit, not Iron Man robot" — keep the human in the
session as the verification step. Interactive sessions mean you can steer
mid-task, answer the agent's questions immediately, and watch it write
memory. The loop's cadence is human-paced: run a session, exit, run another.
Headless batch iteration is a later upgrade once trust is earned, not the
starting point for a beginner.

## Memory: what lives where

Lilian Weng's taxonomy maps human memory onto agents; we implement all three
tiers as plain markdown in an Obsidian vault:

| Tier | Human analogue | Here | Written by |
|------|----------------|------|-----------|
| Short-term | working memory | the session's context window | nobody — discarded each iteration |
| Long-term semantic | facts/concepts | `vault/Knowledge/` — one topic per note | capture skill |
| Long-term episodic | experiences | `vault/Daily/` — one note per day, session log | reflect skill |
| Long-term procedural | skills/habits | `skills/*/SKILL.md` + `agent/config.yaml` | improve skill (gated) |

**Memory loading is infrastructure, not behavior**: a SessionStart hook
(`.claude/settings.json` → `scripts/session-start-hook.sh`) injects
MEMORY.md + the latest daily note + the latest reflection into every
session's context before the model does anything. A skill the model must
remember to invoke can be skipped; a hook cannot. The session-start skill
remains for the protocol's judgment half (state goal + assumptions) and as
manual fallback.

Plus the piece that makes retrieval work:

- **`vault/MEMORY.md`** — the index. One line per fact/goal/note. Loaded
  every session; everything else loaded on demand. This is the
  "index + detail" pattern: the index stays under ~40 lines, detail notes
  hold the content. Practitioner consensus and Anthropic's own memory
  guidance both converge here — a small always-loaded index beats a big
  always-loaded dump.

**Why files, not a vector DB?** Files-first is a legitimate production
architecture (it's how Claude Code's own memory works): human-readable,
git-diffable, portable, zero infra, and Obsidian gives you a free UI with
backlinks and graph view. Vector search earns its complexity when the corpus
outgrows an index a model can scan — hundreds of notes, not dozens. Start
here; MemPalace-style semantic search is a later bolt-on if ever needed.

**Schema rules that prevent memory rot** (the append-only trap):

- Knowledge notes state facts timelessly and get **edited in place** when
  facts change — git holds history, the note holds truth. The capture skill
  checks the index for an existing note before creating one (conflict
  detection on write).
- MEMORY.md sections have caps (10 standing lessons, ~40 lines total) with
  explicit demotion rules, so the index can't silently bloat.
- The raw event stream (Daily/) is append-only and never edited; every
  index/summary is derived and rebuildable from it.

## How self-improvement actually works

Research discriminators between "self-improving" and "merely looping":

1. **Reflection must be re-injected.** Reflexion's entire gain (91% vs 80%
   on HumanEval) comes from routing the post-mortem back into the next
   attempt. Reflection generated but never re-read is ceremony — the most
   common failure in the wild. Here: the SessionStart hook injects the
   latest reflection into every session's context — re-injection is
   guaranteed by infrastructure, not model discipline.

2. **Write-back must be gated.** Voyager's ablation: remove self-verification
   and performance drops 73%. Unverified self-modification makes agents
   worse. Here the gate is the **two-strike rule**: reflect can only propose
   (`status: proposed`); improve applies only signals that repeated across
   2+ sessions. One bad session is noise; the same problem twice is a pattern.

3. **Improvements must be durable artifacts.** Applied changes land in skill
   files, MEMORY.md, or config — things every future session loads. That's
   the compounding channel (and Karpathy's system-prompt-learning idea,
   implemented literally: the agent edits its own instructions).

4. **A human reviews the diff.** Every improvement pass is a git commit.
   Two reasons: audit trail, and an entropy source — loops that feed purely
   on their own outputs converge on their own quirks (Karpathy's model-
   collapse point). Your review injects outside signal.

The full signal path:

```
session goes badly
  → reflect writes: lesson + proposed change (status: proposed)
  → next sessions hit the same issue → "REPEAT SIGNAL" noted
  → user runs agent/reflect.sh
  → improve skill: repeat? concrete target? → edit skill/MEMORY/config
  → status: applied, git commit
  → every future session runs with the sharper instruction
```

## The skills

Atomic on purpose — one job each, so the improve skill can edit one without
side effects on the others, and so each stays small enough to be reliably
followed:

| Skill | One job | Reads | Writes |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| session-start | load memory cheaply | MEMORY.md, latest Daily + Reflection | today's Daily (creates if missing) |
| capture | persist durable facts | MEMORY.md index | Knowledge/, MEMORY.md index line |
| inbox-triage | route captured-elsewhere thoughts | vault/Inbox/, MEMORY.md index | Knowledge/ or Daily/ (human-confirmed), empties Inbox/ |
| profile-interview | learn the user's voice + taste | user, one Q at a time | Profiles/voice-profile.md, Profiles/taste-profile.md |
| reflect | close the session honestly | session context | Daily/, Reflections/, MEMORY.md goals |
| improve | apply repeated signals | Reflections/, MEMORY.md | skills/, CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md lessons, config.yaml |
| loop | orchestrate subagent iterations | MEMORY.md + iteration results | git commits (verified iterations only) |

**The loop skill** is the scaled-up loop: the interactive session becomes
orchestrator + human gate, and each iteration runs in a *subagent* with a
fresh context — recovering the Ralph property (clean slate per iteration)
without giving up the human. It adds the verification the single-session
mode can't: the orchestrator checks each iteration's pass/fail criteria and
reverts unverified memory writes before they're committed (Voyager's
lesson — unverified write-back is where loops stop compounding). Iterations
run sequentially because they share memory files; only read-only research
fans out in parallel.

Guardrails encoded in the skills themselves: reflect never applies, improve
never acts on single occurrences, improve may not weaken its own gates, and
skills stay under ~80 lines (a rule added must displace a rule dropped).

Skills are symlinked (not copied) into `.claude/skills/` so that when improve
edits `skills/reflect/SKILL.md`, the live skill changes immediately and the
diff sits in one place.

## What was deliberately left out

- **Vector search / embeddings** — index + grep covers dozens-to-hundreds of
  notes. Add when retrieval actually misses.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — one loop, one agent. Practitioner guidance:
  iterate deeper before scaling wider.
- **Automated skill generation** — improve edits existing skills; it proposes
  new ones for a human to create. Self-authored skills without review is
  where self-modification goes wrong.
- **YAML parser, task JSON, PRD tooling** — grep-able config and a goal
  string cover the beginner use case. The Ralph-loop task-list pattern is a
  natural upgrade once goals outgrow one sentence.
