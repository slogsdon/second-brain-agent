description: Close out an agent session. Use at the END of every session — logs what happened to the daily note, then writes an honest self-assessment to Reflections/ with one actionable lesson.

# Reflect

One job: end the session with an honest written record — what happened
(episodic memory) and what to do differently (improvement signal).

This is the heart of self-improvement. A reflection that never gets written,
or is written as vague praise, breaks the whole loop.

## Steps

1. **Log the session** — append to today's `vault/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under
   `## Sessions`:

   ```markdown
   ### HH:MM — <short session title>

   - Goal: <what this session set out to do>
   - Did: <what actually happened, including links to any [[Knowledge notes]] captured>
   - Outcome: <done / partial / blocked — and why>
   - Open: <what the next session should pick up, or "nothing">
   ```

2. **Write the reflection** — create or append to
   `vault/Reflections/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## Session: <title> (HH:MM)

   ### What worked
   - <specific behavior that helped>

   ### What didn't
   - <specific behavior that hurt — be honest, this is the improvement signal>

   ### Lesson (one sentence, actionable)
   <a rule a future session could actually follow>

   ### Proposed change
   - target: <skills/<name>/SKILL.md | CLAUDE.md | vault/MEMORY.md | config.yaml | none>
   - change: <one sentence describing the edit>
   - status: proposed
   ```

3. **Update MEMORY.md active goals** — mark the goal done or update its
   one-line status. Keep the section current; stale goals rot the index.

4. **Commit memory** — `git add vault/ && git commit -m "chore: memory update — <short summary>"`.
   Every session leaves an auditable trail.

## Rules

- Reflect does NOT apply changes. It only proposes them (`status: proposed`).
  The improve skill applies them later, when a signal has repeated. This gate
  is deliberate: unverified self-modification makes agents worse, not better.
- "What didn't" must contain something real. A session where nothing went
  wrong still had something inefficient. If truly nothing: write "no signal"
  — but that should be rare.
- One lesson per session, not five. Pick the one that matters most.
- If the same lesson already appears in a previous reflection, say so
  explicitly: "REPEAT SIGNAL — also in YYYY-MM-DD". Repeats are what
  authorize the improve skill to act.
